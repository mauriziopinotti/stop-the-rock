Libraries

The EndlessScrollView has been inspired by https://github.com/ciandt-mobile/android-recyclerview-binding


Going further

What I would had done having more time:
- responsive two-columns layout for tablets
- unit tests with mock jsons
- review all warnings in the build output
- sonarqube pass
- better error handling
- profiling of application code
